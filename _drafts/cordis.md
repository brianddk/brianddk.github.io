Trying to understand how calculators work lead to research on CORDIS and log tables.  The following are some *bread crumbs* related to that research

1. [CORDIC Trig approximations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC)
2. [Calculate exp() and log() with tables](http://www.quinapalus.com/efunc.html)
3. [Henry Briggs and the HP35](http://home.citycable.ch/pierrefleur/Jacques-Laporte/Briggs%20and%20the%20HP35.htm)
4. [A reconstruction of the tables of Briggs' Arithmetica logarithmica](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00543939/document)
5. [Methods to Approximate Roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots) - aka. How did Briggs calc roots?

Some other reading to get back to
